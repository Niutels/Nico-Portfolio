## Why do we care?

* Need of a human model to test controllers on a simulated Exoskeleton
* Existing simulations for human bodies are computationally expensive
* Countless robotics applications for Human-robot simulated interactions
* Improving robots haptics feedback
* Understanding of human body dynamics

## How would we do that?

A recent [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10560) done during the

[exoskeleton project](https://nicolas-robotics-portfolio.netlify.app/exoskeleton)

had allowed to identify a model explaining how human body joints behave dynamically. The first thought which came to my mind when watching this happen was to replicate this feature into robots using this model as an inspiration! More extensive reports and useful figures can be found below:
